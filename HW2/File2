Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans.
In three words I can sum up everything I've learned about life: it goes on.
Be the change that you wish to see in the world.
All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.
The only way to do great work is to love what you do.
You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.
